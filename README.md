# Surfs up Analysis
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to provide weather information to investor W. Avy for the area Surfs Up will be located as there may be risks due to weather. We will be providing him with weather statistics for Oahu to ease his concerns on whether the weather will affect the business. 

## Results:
### Three key differences in weather between June and December 
•	The minimum temperature in December is 8 degrees lower (56) than the minimum temperature in June (64). 

•	There were 183 more temperature changes in June than in December. 

•	Because the minimum temp for December is 56 and the max is 83, there is more different temperatures that Oahu experienced (27 different temps) in December than in June (21 different temps) 

## Summary:

The temperatures for both June and December are too different overall as the range of temps for June goes between 64 and 85 while December goes between 56 and 83. Typically the higher temps are happening during the daylight hours which would be prime hours to have the shop open as the crowds are bigger at the beach then. The lower temps then probably are during the evening hours and go throughout the night. This would not be too much of a problem as cooler temps seem to be experienced year around and if that’s the case, the locals probably enjoy ice cream even during the lower temps. To support my previous claims though, I would run query that includes times of the temperatures experienced year-round. Another query I would suggest would be one that determines the average of the chance of rainfall daily and include the last couple of years to determine if it is consistent to especially focusing on years with higher rainfall. While weather is unpredictable, it helps to be able to see yearly, monthly, and even daily patterns.
